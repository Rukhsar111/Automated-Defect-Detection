# Automated-Defect-Detection

In  manufacturing industry,Quality control and Quality assurance are very crucial things to maintain. Detecting anomalies on the production line ensures the best quality products and can save time and money for various bussinesses. 

This project aims to develop an AI-based defect detection system capable of identifying defects in various materials such as Metals and  Glasses to maintain the Quality Standards Using  "**Anomalib**" a deep learning Library consist various state of the art defect detection Algorithms.. The system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze images and detect anomalies with high accuracy.

## Features
- Detects defects in images of materials or products
- Supports multiple types of defects detection
- High accuracy and reliability
- Easy to integrate into existing systems
- Scalable for large-scale manufacturing environments
